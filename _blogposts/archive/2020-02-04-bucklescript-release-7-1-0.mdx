title: Announcing BuckleScript 7.1.0

## About this Release

`bs-platform@7.1.0` is a major release. You can try it with `npm i -g
bs-platform`!  (If you have permission issues, try `sudo npm i --unsafe-perm -g
bs-platform`)

It was called 7.0.2 but bumped into 7.1.0 due to a soundness fix (a breaking
change) as follows:

Previously, the empty array `[||]` was polymorphic. This happens to be true,
since in native an array is not resizable, so users cannot do anything with it.
But in JS, we introduced a binding for `push` which can change the size of an
array dynamically. In this case, an empty array cannot be polymorphic any more.

Removing `push` is possible, but it makes arrays in JS context less useful. To
fix this issue while keeping `push`, we make `[||]` weakly typed so that its
type inference is deferred until the first time it is used. If it is never used
across the module, it has to be annotated with a concrete type; otherwise, the
type checker will complain.

Several highlighted features are listed as follows:

## Raw JavaScript Parsing/Checking

BuckleScript allows users to embed raw JavaScript code as an escape hatch; it
used to treat such piece of code as a black box.

In this release we vendor a JavaScript parser (thanks to
[flowtype](https://github.com/facebook/flow)) for syntax checking and simple
semantics analysis over `raw`. This is on-going work, but it is already useful
now.

First, we now report syntax errors properly for `raw`.

Second, for simple semantics analysis, we can tell whether the code inside raw
is a function or not and the arity of raw function:

```ocaml
let f = [%raw "function(x){return x}"]
```
```reason
let f = [%raw "function(x){return x}"];
```

Now we know `f` is a function declaration with no side effect; it can be
removed by the dead code analyzer if not used. We also know its arity so that
when it's called we know whether it's fully applied or not.

Because this sort of information can be derived from `raw` directly, the
special `raw` form we introduced as follows is no longer needed:

```ocaml
let f = fun%raw x -> {|x|}
```

```reason
let f = [%raw x => {|x|}];
```

To reduce interop API surface, this feature will now be discouraged.

We're also exploring using such knowledge on JS literals and regexes checking.

## Unboxed Types

One major feature introduced in this release is **unboxed types** which is
blogged [here](https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/12/20/release-7-02).

## Uniform Warning System

Previously warnings are reported in two ways:
- The OCaml compiler style: `-w +10`
- Ad-hoc warnings introduced by flags `-bs-warn-unimplemented-external`


In this release, we  make such integration so that BuckleScript warnings are
handled in the same way as OCaml's own warnings, for example, the warning
attribute below can also turn off  BuckleScript warnings now.

```reason
[@warning "-101"]; // file-level config
```

Based on this effort, we have changed all BuckleScript warnings into OCaml
style warnings to reduce user-level complexity.

The newly introduced warnings are listed via `bsc -warn-help`:

```
101 BuckleScript warning: Unused bs attributes
102 BuckleScript warning: polymorphic comparison introduced (maybe unsafe)
103 BuckleScript warning: about fragile FFI definitions
104 BuckleScript warning: bs.deriving warning with customized message
105 BuckleScript warning: the external name is inferred from val name is unsafe from refactoring when changing value name
106 BuckleScript warning: Unimplemented primitive used:
107 BuckleScript warning: Integer literal exceeds the range of representable integers of type int
108 BuckleScript warning: Uninterpreted delimiters (for unicode)
```

We also recommend users to turn on `warnerror` and only disable warnings for
some specific files.

We've also upgraded the Reason parser `refmt` to 3.6.0.
