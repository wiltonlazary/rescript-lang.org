## New Release

We are happy to announce BuckleScript 8.1.1, which features syntax tweaks to the [newly released syntax](https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax) and also adds new capabilities for converting and formatting your code via the `bsc` command.

There are no breaking changes. You can install it with `npm install bs-platform@8.1.1`.

## Newest Syntax Tweaks

Based on the [feedback thread](https://reasonml.chat/t/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax-option) from our [previous new BuckleScript syntax announcement](https://reasonml.org/blog/bucklescript-8-1-new-syntax), we've made some tweaks:

- `list[1, 2, 3]` is now `list{1, 2, 3}`.
- `` `hello ðŸ‘‹ ${message}` `` quoted string now supports proper unicode and type-safe interpolation.

Small changes, big difference. This release also marks our syntax's **feature freeze** for existing features: updates to the syntax in the near to medium term only be additive or contain bug fixes, no breaking changes.

## A New Converter and Formatter Flag for `bsc`

We added a new experimental flag `-fmt`, which allows you to  format any `.res`/`.resi` file, or convert any `.re`/`.rei`/`.ml`/`.mli` file to the new syntax.

**Usage:** `bsc -fmt MyFile.res` will print out the pretty printed content of `MyFile.res` to stdout.

To convert any Reason or OCaml file, just pipe the output to a new `res` file: `node_modules/.bin/bsc -fmt src/Button.re > src/Button.res`

Please note that this CLI flag is still experimental until we settle on the final API (e.g. we want to add support for passing additional parameters to the formatter, such as accepting stdin).

We are happy for feedback! Make sure to use [this forum post](https://reasonml.chat/t/the-formatter-converter-for-the-new-syntax-is-available-for-testing/2423) for general discussions, or the [new syntax](https://github.com/BuckleScript/syntax) issue trackers for bug reports.

Enjoy!
