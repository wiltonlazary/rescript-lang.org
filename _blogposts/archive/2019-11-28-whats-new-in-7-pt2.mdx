## New `dev` Release

The second dev release
[7.0.0-dev.2](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/pull/3995) is
released for testing!

As we mentioned in the [previous
post](https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/11/18/whats-new-in-7), we
compile records into js objects in this release. This makes the generated code
more idiomatic, however, this is not enough to write idiomatic bindings to
manipulate arbitrary js objects, since the key of js objects can be arbitrary
which is not expressible in ReasonML syntax, so we support user level
customization now, which makes idiomatic bindings really easy.

```reason
type entry = {
  [@bs.as "EXACT_MAPPING_TO_JS_LABEL"]
  x: int,
  [@bs.as "EXACT_2"]
  y: int,
  z: obj,
}
and obj = {
  [@bs.as "hello"]
  hi: int,
};

let f4 = ({x, y, z: {hi}}) => (x + y + hi) * 2;
```

```js
function f4(param) {
  return (((param.EXACT_MAPPING_TO_JS_LABEL + param.EXACT_2 | 0) + param.z.hello | 0) << 1);
}
```

As you can see, you can manipulate js objects using Reason pattern match syntax, the generated
code is highly efficient, more importantly, bindings to JS will be significantly simplifie.

Happy Hacking.
