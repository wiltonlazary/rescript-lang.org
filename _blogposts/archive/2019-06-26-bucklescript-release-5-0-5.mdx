title: Announcing BuckleScript 5.0.5 and 6.0.2
description: |
---

`bs-platform` 5.0.5 (for OCaml 4.02.3) and 6.0.2 (for OCaml 4.06.1) is
released.

A detailed list of changes is available
[here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#505)

It has some critical bug fixes that we suggest users to upgrade.

Some feature enhancement is described as below:

## User land C stubs polyfill

Previously, for existing OCaml libraries which rely on some C primitives, it
has to be patched in source level. In this release, user can provide such
support independently without patching the source code.

Suppose you have a Reason module which relies on an C primitive as below:

```reason
external ff : (int,int) => int = "caml_fancy_add" ;
```

`caml_fancy_add` is a C function for native code, now we can provide this
support in a js files, what user needs to do is adding `caml_fancy_add` to a
global variable like this

```js
/**
 * @param {int} x
 * @param {int} y
 * @returns {int}
 *
 */
require('bs-platform/lib/js/caml_external_polyfill.js').register('caml_fancy_add',function(x,y){
  return + ((""+x ) + (""+y))
})
```

Note this is an experimental feature that we don't suggest users to use it
extensively, it is provided as an escape hatch. We are also expecting feedback
to see how we could improve it, so there might be some backward incompatible
changes.

## A new warning number 105

Previously, there are some scenarios that the Js function name is inferred
during the interop.

For example
```ocaml
external f : int -> int = "" [@@bs.val]
```
```reason
[@bs.val] external f : int => int = ""
```
Here the JS function name is inferred as `f` which is the same as OCaml
function name.

Such ffi declaration is fragile to refactoring when changing names of f, it
will also change the name of js function name which is probably not what user
expected.

105 warning number is to help warn against this case (turned on by default).

## Simplified debugger mode

Previously, user has to add `-bs-g` flag to `bsc-flags` in `bsconfig.json` and
add one line code to the main module. Such code change is no longer needed,
only the flag is needed.

## Build performance improvement

We improved the build performance and simplified the design of the build
significantly in this release, we will have a separate post about it.

Happy hacking!
