## New Changes

`bs-platform@5.0.0` is released! There are quite a few bug fixes in this
release  and refmt is synced up, a detailed list of changes is available
[here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#500).


Several new features are introduced in this release:

- first class `bs.variadic` support, documented
  [here](/blog/feature-preview-variadic)

- we prebuilt binaries for Windows, MacOS and Linux, this will help reduce your
  CI build time significantly. For exotic OSes, it will fall back to build from
  source

- bs.deriving light config. For people who prefer short names, we make it
  configurable

```
[@bs.deriving { abstract: light }]
type t = {x: int};

let f = (obj: t) => obj->x;
```

This is the last major release which is targeting OCaml 4.02.3, in the future
we will make major releases targeting OCaml 4.06.

Happy Hacking!
