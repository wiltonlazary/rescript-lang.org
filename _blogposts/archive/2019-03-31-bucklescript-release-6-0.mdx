## New Test Release

`bs-platform@6.0.0-dev.1` is released, you can try it with `npm i -g
bs-platform@next`!  (if you have permission issues, try `sudo npm i
--unsafe-perm -g bs-platform@next`)

This is the first release that bucklescript compiler using OCaml 4.06.1
typechecker.

It also means that most language features from OCaml will trickle down
automatically.

It is not yet ready for production but we recommend you to try it (esp, new
OCaml features between 4.02.3 and 4.06.1), note we expect users to have some
issues in experiment, feedback is welcome!
