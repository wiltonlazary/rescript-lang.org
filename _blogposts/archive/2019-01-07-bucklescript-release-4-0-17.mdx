## Newest Changes

`bs-platform` 4.0.17 is a major release.

It improved incremental compilation time significantly.

A picture is worth a thousand words, below is a large monorepo which contains
4096 modules, changing the root node which has more than 3000 dependents, it
finished building within 400ms.

We will write a dedicated article explaining how we achieve this incredible
build performance.

A detailed list of changes is available
[here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#4017)

Another quite important but not client facing change is that we renovated the
internal build system, it will be much easier for contribution later on.  We
will update the contribution guide once it gets stable.
