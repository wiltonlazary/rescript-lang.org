title: Improving the Stdlib Loading mechanism
description: |
  We want to give you some insights on how we will improve the way BuckleScript
  compiles and handles its stdlib modules.
---

## Loading stdlib from memory

<!-- Do you mean "external files" instead of "external file system"? In Linux world, a file system is means something like EXT4 or btrfs -->

In the next release, we are going to load stdlib from memory instead of from
external files, which will make the BuckleScript toolchain more accessible and
performant.

You can try it via `npm i bs-platform@7.2.0-dev.4`

## How does it work

When the compiler compiles a module `test.ml`, the module `Test` will import
some modules from stdlib. This is inevitable since even basic operators in
BuckleScript, for example `(+)`, are defined in the Pervasives module, which is
part of the stdlib.

Traditionally, the compiler will consult `Pervasives.cmi`, which is a binary
artifact describing the interface of the Pervasives module and
`Pervasives.cmj`, which is a binary artifact describing the implementation of
the Pervasives module. `Pervasives.cm[ij]` and other modules in stdlib are
shipped together with the compiler.


**This traditional mode has some consequences:**

- The compiler is not stand-alone and relocatable. Even if we have the compiler
prebuilt for different platforms, we still have to compile stdlib
post-installation. `postinstall` is supported by npm, but it has
[various](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3213)
[issues](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/2799)
[against](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/3254) yarn.

- It's hard to split the compiler from the generated stdlib JS artifacts. When
a BuckleScript user deploys apps depending on BuckleScript, in theory, the app
only needs to deploy those generated JS artifacts; the native binary is not
needed in production. However, the artifacts are still loaded since they are
bundled together. Allowing easy delivery of compiled code is one of the
communityâ€™s most desired [feature
requests](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/2772).


In this release, we solve the problem by embedding the binary artifacts into
the compiler directly and loading it on demand.

To make this possible, we try to make the binary data platform agnostic and as
compact as possible to avoid size bloating. The entrance of loading cmi/cmj has
to be adapted to this new way.

So whenever the compiler tries to load a module from stdlib, it will consult a
lazy data structure in the compiler itself instead of consulting an external
file system.

## What are the benefits?

<!-- In the phrase "we can make it installable", what does "it" refer to? -->

### More accessiblity.

Package installation now becomes downloading for prebuilt platforms. In the
future, we can make it installable from a system package manager as well. The
subtle interaction with [yarn
reinstall](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/2799) is also
solved once and for all.

<!-- instead of "between compiler and stdlib version schemes", perhaps say "for aligning compiler and stdlib version schemes" -->

### Easy separation between compiler and JS artifacts

The compiler is just one relocatable file. This makes the separation between
the compiler and generated JS artifacts easier. The remaining work is mostly to
design a convention between compiler and stdlib version schemes.

### Better compilation performance

A large set of files is not loaded from the file system but rather from memory
now!

### Fast installation and reinstallation.

Depending on your network speed, the installation is reduced from 15
seconds to 3 seconds. Reinstallation is almost a no-op now.

<!-- TODO: collect data points later -->

<!-- I'm not sure what you mean by "compiling a single file to a string" -->

### JS playground is easier to build

We translate the compiler into JS so that
developers can play with it in the browser.  To make this happen, we used to
fake the IO system; this not needed any more since no IO happens when compiling
a single file to a string.

## Some internal changes

To make this happen, the layout of binaries has been changed to the following
structure. It is **not recommended** that users depend on the layout, but [it
happens](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/pull/4170#issuecomment-586959464).
Here is the new layout:

```
|-- bsb // node wrapper of bsb.exe
|-- bsc // node wrapper of bsc.exe
|
|-- win32
|     |-- bsb.exe
|     |-- bsc.exe
|
|---darwin
|     |-- bsb.exe
|     |-- bsc.exe
|
|---linux
|     |-- bsb.exe
|     |-- bsc.exe

```
