## New Changes

`bs-platform` 3.0.0 is released! Go get it. This is a great release.

**Highlighted features:**

- **OCaml/Reason boolean are finally compiled as JS boolean**! Due to
  historical limitations, OCaml `true`/`false` was compiled to `1`/`0` in JS.
  This caused quite a bit of confusion for newcomers. It now compiles to JS
  `true`/`false`. Special thanks to [Cristiano](https://twitter.com/ccrisccris)
  for all the hard work.
- New `[bs.deriving abstract`] feature. This is
  an experimental and potentially much better way to bind to JS objects that
  potentially obsoletes the need for a few other APIs. Please see the linked
  docs and help us test it!
- `raw` now accepts a function declaration with an unsafe string body: `let f =
  [%raw (a, b) => "return a + b"]` (OCaml syntax: `let f = [%raw fun a b ->
  "return a + b"]`). This makes embedding escape-hatch raw JS code even easier
  for the compiler to optimize for speed and readability, as you've indicated
    that the raw code block is a function, with specific numbers of arguments.

The usual changelog is
[here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#300).

We've been working on the BuckleScript compiler for almost four years now;
meanwhile, the OCaml type checker itself has already been engineered for almost
three decades. After all this of work, we believe that BuckleScript has reached
a stable and reliable stage.

Below is a list of to-dos that we will work on in the future. Suggestions
welcome!

- Upgrade the OCaml version. OCaml is quite a stable language; there are not
  too many changes between BuckleScript's OCaml version and latest stable one.
  Nonetheless, it's good to keep up with the OCaml ecosystem.
- A uniform representation for local modules/global modules. Currently local
  modules are compiled to array, while global modules are compiled to
  ES6/CommonJS/AMD modules (the cost of local modules is low though, thanks to
  aggressive inlining).
- Continue improving
  [Belt](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Belt.html). Some
  initial nice numbers [here](https://github.com/bobzhang/belt-simple-bench).
- Enhance FFI to allow creation of idiomatic, type safe JS classes.
- Introduce a debug mode to enhance the printing of OCaml data structures.
- Performance. The compiler performance and generation of more performant and
  readable code is always our top concern.

Thank you for all the support so far!
