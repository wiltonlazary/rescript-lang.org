Please see [Better Data Structures Printing (Debug
Mode)](/docs/reason-compiler/latest/better-data-structures-printing-debug-mode) for usage.

## Even Better `bs.deriving abstract`

We've further polished our new way of binding to JS objects. The record fields
of a `bs.deriving abstract` can now accept functions.

## Pipe First Improvement

[Pipe First](/docs/manual/latest/pipe) now supports piping into variant tags!

```reason
let result = name |. preprocess |. Some
```

We turn this into:

```reason
let result = Some(preprocess(name))
```

### Js.Boolean Is Gone

Since BuckleScript 3.0, OCaml `bool` now compile to JS `boolean`. It was
deprecated (all the boolean conversion functions became no-ops, with warnings
during build), and now completely removed. No more need for the converter
functions!
