## New Release

Hey again! The release two days ago removed the deprecated Js Boolean APIs (no
longer needed since we compile OCaml booleans to JS boolean since `3.0.0`). But
folks have voiced that the removal was too hasty, as some of their dependencies
still haven't upgraded to `3.0.0` and thus still needed the deprecated APIs.

We try to be diligent with our releases; hopefully this didn't churn too many
people. To remediate the situation, **we're putting those calls back for this
version**. Finger crossed that you don't have to wait on too many dependencies!

Sorry for the small churn, and thanks for all your feedback!
