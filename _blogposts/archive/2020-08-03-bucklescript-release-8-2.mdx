## New Release

We are happy to announce BuckleScript 8.2, which comes with a great feature: string literal types.

This is an exciting feature so we wrote a [dedicated blog post](https://reasonml.org/blog/string-literal-types-in-reason) about it.

Besides the exciting string literal types, this release continues to deliver better compilation performance. Some internal data structures underlying the compiler were tweaked. This led to an overall compiler memory usage reduction of about 40%.

Thanks to the integration of Flow parser, we are able to make the JS interop [more safe and expressive](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/issues/4463)


The full changes are listed [here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md)

Enjoy!
