## New Release

We are excited to announce `bs-platform@1.7.3` with following new highlighted features:

### New CLI template generator

You can now create and build a new BuckleScript project in a single command
(works on all platforms with zero dependencies including Windows)

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform && bsb -init hello && cd hello && npm run build
```

You can find more details in the
[manual](http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_using_existing_templates_since_1_7_4).


### Adding several modules to Js namespace, including Option, Result, List and Vector.

Note it is still work in progress, but these libraries are optimized for both
performance and size, they can provide an even smaller code size than current
case


You can also find a full list of changes in our
[Changelog](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#bucklescript-174may-24-2017)
file.
