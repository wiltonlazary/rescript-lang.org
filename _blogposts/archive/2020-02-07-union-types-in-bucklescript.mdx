title: Union types in BuckleScript
description: |
  In our our 7.1.0 release we introduced the new [@unboxed] feature for better
  zero-cost interop with GADTs, Variants and single field records. Let's find
  out how this will help us expressing Union types with seamless interop!

## Introduction to Union Types

[Union
types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#union-types)
describe a value that can be one of several types. In JS, it is common to use
the vertical bar (|) to separate each type, so `number | string | boolean`  is
the type of a value that can be a number, a string, or a boolean.


Following [the last
post](https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/12/20/release-7-02) since the
introduction of unboxed attributes in `7.1.0`, we can create such types as
follows:

```ocaml
type t =
    | Any : 'a  -> t
[@@unboxed]
let a (v : a) = Any v
let b (v : b) = Any v
let c (v : c) = Any v
```
```reason
[@unboxed]
type t =
  | Any('a): t;
let a = (v: a) => Any(v);
let b = (v: b) => Any(v);
let c = (v: c) => Any(v);
```
> **Note:** due to the `unboxed` attribute, `Any a` shares the same runtime
> representation as `a`; however, we need to make sure that user can only
> construct values of type `a`, `b` , or `c` into type `t`. By making use of the
> module system, we can achieve this:

```ocaml
module A_b_c : sig
  type t
  val a : a -> t
  val b : b -> t
  val c : c -> t
end= struct
type t =
    | Any : 'a  -> t
[@@unboxed]
let a (v : a) = Any v
let b (v : b) = Any v
let c (v : c) = Any v
end
```

```reason
module A_b_c: {
  type t;
  let a: a => t;
  let b: b => t;
  let c: c => t;
} = {
  [@unboxed]
  type t =
    | Any('a): t;
  let a = (v: a) => Any(v);
  let b = (v: b) => Any(v);
  let c = (v: c) => Any(v);
};
```
<!-- Union types are useful for modeling situations when values can overlap in the types they can take on.  -->
What happens when we need to know specifically whether we have a value of type `a`? This is a case by case issue; it depends on whether there are some intersections in the runtime encoding of `a`, `b` or `c`. For some primitive types, it is easy enough to use `Js.typeof` to tell the difference between, e.g, `number` and `string`.

Like [type guards in typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types), we have to trust the user knowledge to differentiate between union types. However, such user level knowledge is isolated in a single module so that we can reason about its correctness locally.

Let's have a simple example, `number_or_string` first:

```ocaml
module Number_or_string : sig
    type t
    type case =
        | Number of float
        | String of string
    val number : float -> t
    val string : string -> t
    val classify : t -> case
end = struct
    type t =
        | Any : 'a -> t
    [@@unboxed]
    type case =
        | Number of float
        | String of string
    let number (v : float) = Any v
    let string (v : string) = Any v
    let classify (Any v : t) : case =
        if Js.typeof v = "number" then Number (Obj.magic v  : float)
        else String (Obj.magic v : string)
end
```
```reason
module Number_or_string: {
  type t;
  type case =
    | Number(float)
    | String(string);
  let number: float => t;
  let string: string => t;
  let classify: t => case;
} = {
  [@unboxed]
  type t =
    | Any('a): t;
  type case =
    | Number(float)
    | String(string);
  let number = (v: float) => Any(v);
  let string = (v: string) => Any(v);
  let classify = (Any(v): t): case =>
    if (Js.typeof(v) == "number") {
      Number(Obj.magic(v): float);
    } else {
      String(Obj.magic(v): string);
    };
};
```
Note that here we use `Obj.magic` to do an unsafe type cast which relies on `Js.typeof`. In practice, people may use `instanceof`; the following is an imaginary example:

```ocaml
module A_or_b : sig
    type t
    val a : a -> t
    val b : b -> t
    type case =
        | A of a
        | B of b
    val classify : t -> case
end = struct
    type t =
        | Any : 'a -> t
    [@@unboxed]
    type case =
        | A of a
        | B of b
    let a (v : a) = Any v
    let b = (v : b) = Any v
    let classify ( Any v : t)  =
        if [%raw{|function (a) { return  a instanceof globalThis.A}|}] v then A (Obj.magic v : a)
        else B (Obj.magic b)
end
```
```reason
module A_or_b: {
  type t;
  let a: a => t;
  let b: b => t;
  type case =
    | A(a)
    | B(b);
  let classify: t => case;
} = {
  [@unboxed]
  type t =
    | Any('a): t;
  type case =
    | A(a)
    | B(b);
  let a = (v: a) => Any(v);
  let b = (v: b) => Any(v);
  let classify = (Any (v): t) =>
    if ([%raw {|function (a) { return  a instanceof globalThis.A}|}](v)) {
      A(Obj.magic(v): a);
    } else {
      B(Obj.magic(b));
    };
};
```
Here we suppose `a` is of JS class type `A`, and we use `instanceof` to test it. Note we use some `unsafe` code locally, but as long as such code is carefully reviewed, it has a safe boundary at the module level.


To conclude: thanks to `unboxed` attributes and the module language, we introduce a systematic way to convert values from `union types` (untagged union types) to `algebraic data types` (tagged union types). This sort of conversion relies on user level knowledge and has to be reviewed carefully. For some cases where `classify` is not needed, it can be done in a completely type safe way.
