## Editor Integration Has Finally Landed

Thank you so much for the wait!

**Here are all the features:**
- Highlighting
- Formatting
- Diagnostics
- Jump to definition
- Autocompletion with markdown preview
- Type hint on hover

We've doubled down on the depth of features instead of breath; hopefully these few crucial ones can stay fast and robust in your big production codebases!

For VSCode, install [rescript-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode) in your editor. For vim, install our [vim-rescript](https://github.com/rescript-lang/vim-rescript) extension and configure it with your preferred setup (plain vim or with coc-vim).

The plugins require `bs-platform@8.3.3`, though also works with slightly older versions.

We'll keep on iterating on the polish of the plugins, and release better [Sublime Text support](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-sublime) soon.

Happy thanksgiving!
