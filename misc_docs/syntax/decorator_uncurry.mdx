The `@uncurry` decorator can be used to mark any callback argument within an **external** function as an uncurried function without the need for any [explicit uncurried function syntax](/docs/manual/latest/function#uncurried-function) `((.) => { ... })`.

### Example

In the following example we are binding to a function `map(arr, callback)` and use the `@uncurry` annotation to make sure that `callback` is always treated as an uncurried function:

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
@send
external map: (array<'a>, @uncurry ('a => 'b)) => array<'b> = "map"

let result = map([1, 2, 3], x => x + 1)
```

```js
var result = [1, 2, 3].map(function (x) {
  return (x + 1) | 0
})
```

</CodeTab>

As we can see, we defined a regular function `('a) => 'b` instead of `(. 'a) => 'b`, but still have all the guarantees. Please note that the compiler does a lot of optimizations, so the example above will compile to the same code even without the `@uncurry` decorator. Adding the decorator (or using the `(.) =>` syntax) makes the output 100% predictable though.
