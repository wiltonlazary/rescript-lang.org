`let` is used to _bind_ values to names, which is similar to assigning values to variables in other languages. 

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let greeting = "hello!"
let score = 10
let newScore = 10 + score
```

```js
var newScore = 20;
var greeting = "hello!";
var score = 10;
```

</CodeTab>
