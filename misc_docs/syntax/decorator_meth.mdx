The `@meth` decorator is used to call a function on a JavaScript object,
and avoid issues with currying.

### Example

Suppose we have the following JavaScript:

```js
function say (a, b) {
  console.log(a, b);
};

var john = { 
  say
};
```

We can model and bind to this object as follows.

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
type person = {@meth "say": (string, string) => unit}

@val external john: person = "john"

john["say"]("hey", "jude")
```

```js
john.say("hey", "jude");
```

</CodeTab>
