# Changelog


This changelog documents significant changes that caused a new version in the manual, or other related resources.

We don't create a version fork for every minor release, and try to make docs "append only" as much as possible. Usually when we introduce a new feature we add a `since 9.0` annotation to a specific section, and be done with it.

For bigger substantial changes (e.g. when we removed the `bs.` prefix, or introduced the `rescript` package in 9.1.0), we fork the version to have a cleaner look on the actual state.

Here are the notes on major changes we did, and how the version corresponds to specific version ranges.
