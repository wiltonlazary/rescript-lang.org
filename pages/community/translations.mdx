# Translations
The ReScript project is exclusively curated in English, but there are also community-driven projects for translating the docs into different languages.

**Note:** Our documentation platform is still in the shaping process, and we don't have any bigger plans introducing i18n / translation features just yet. If you decide to translate our resources, please make sure to follow SEO best practises and most importantly, add [canonical](https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization) references to point to the original source, otherwise we might get mixed results with SEO / google search. When in doubt, please reach out to us [in the forum](https://forum.rescript-lang.org).
