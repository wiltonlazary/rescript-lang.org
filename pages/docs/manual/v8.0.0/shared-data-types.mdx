# Shared Data Types

ReScript's built-in values of type `string`, `float`, `array` and a few others have a rather interesting property: they compile to the exact same value in JavaScript!

This means that if you're passing e.g. a ReScript string to the JavaScript side, the JS side can directly use it as a native JS string. It also means that you can import a JS string and pretend it's a native ReScript string.

Unlike most compiled-to-js languages, in ReScript, **you don't need to write data converters back and forth for most of our values**!

**Shared, bidirectionally usable types**:
- String. Backtick strings like `` `hello $(personName)` `` (in old ML syntax: `{j|hello $(personName)|j}`) support interpolation. Normal `"hello"` strings don't.
- Float. ReScript floats are JS numbers, vice-versa.
- Array. In addition to the [JS Array API](api/js/array), we provide our own [Belt.Array](api/belt/array#set) API too.
- Tuple. Compiles to a JS array. You can treat a fixed-sized, heterogenous JS array as ReScript tuple too.
- Boolean.
- Record. Record compiles to JS object. Therefore you can also treat JS objects as records. If they're too dynamic, consider modeling them on the ReScript side as a hashmap/dictionary [`Js.Dict`](api/js/dict) or a ReScript object.
- Object. ReScript objects are JavaScript objects, vice-versa.
- Function. They compile to clean JS functions.
- Module. ReScript files are considered top-level modules, and are compiled to JS files 1 to 1. Nested modules are compiled to JavaScript objects.
- Unit. The `unit` type, which has a single value `()`, compiles to `undefined` too. Likewise, you can treat an incoming JS `undefined` as `()`.

<!-- TODO: talk about poly variant -->

**Types that are slightly different than JS, but that you can still use from JS**:
- Int. **Ints are 32-bits**! Be careful, you can potentially treat them as JS numbers and vice-versa, but if the number's large, then you better treat JS numbers as floats. For example, we bind to [`Js.Date`](api/js/date) using `float`s.
- Option. The `option` type's `None` value compiles into JS `undefined`. The `Some` value, e.g. `Some(5)`, compiles to `5`. Likewise, you can treat an incoming JS `undefined` as `None`. **JS `null` isn't handled here**. If your JS value can be `null`, use [Js.Nullable](api/js/nullable) helpers.
- Exception.

**Non-shared types (aka internal types)**:

- Variant. They don't exist in JS.
- List, which is just a regular variant.
- Character.
- Int64.
- Lazy values.
- Everything else.

The non-shared types need your manual conversions if you want to export them for JS consumption. For a seamless JS / TypeScript / Flow integration experience, you might want to use [genType](https://github.com/cristianoc/gentype) instead of doing conversions by hand.
