# Build System Overview

ReScript comes with a build system, bsb, that's meant to be fast, lean and used as the authoritative build system of the community.

The build description file is called `bsconfig.json`. Every ReScript project needs one.

## Build Project 

Each build will create build artifacts from your project's source files.

**To build a project (including its dependencies / pinned-dependencies)**, run:

```sh
bsb -make-world
```

Add `-w` to keep the built-in watcher running. Any new file change will be picked up and the build will re-run.

**Note**: third-party libraries (in `node_modules`, or via `pinned-dependencies`) aren't watched, as doing so may exceed the node.js watcher count limit.

**Note 2**: In case you want to set up a project in a JS-monorepo-esque approach (`yarn workspaces` / `lerna`) where changes in your sub packages should be noticed by the compiler (`bsb -make-world`), you will need to define pinned dependencies in your main project's `bsconfig.json`. More details [here](./build-pinned-dependencies).

**To build only your project's files (without dependencies)**, run:


```sh
bsb
```

## Clean Project

If you ever get into a stale build for edge-case reasons, use:

```sh
bsb -clean-world
```

This will clean all your project's build artifacts, including those in your dependencies. Alternatively you can run `bsb -clean` to clean your project's build artifacts only.

For more infos, run `bsb -help` to see all the available options.
